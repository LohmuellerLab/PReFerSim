# PReFerSim

PReFerSim is an ANSI C program that performs forward simulations under the PRF model. PReFerSim models changes in population size, arbitrary amounts of inbreeding, dominance, and distributions of selective effects. Users can track summaries of genetic variation over time and output trajectories of selected alleles.  

A detailed user manual and example files are provided along with the program.

A manuscript describing PReFerSim has been submitted.
